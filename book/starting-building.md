# Building PX4 Software

PX4 can be built on the console or in a graphical development environment / IDE.

## Compiling on the Console

Before moving on to a graphical editor or IDE, it is important to validate the system setup. Do so by bringing up the terminal. On OS X, hit âŒ˜-space and search for 'terminal'. On Ubuntu, click the launch bar and search for 'terminal'. On Windows, find the PX4 folder in the start menu and click on 'PX4 Console'.

![](images/toolchain/terminal.png)

The terminal starts in the home directory. We default to '~/src/Firmware' and clone the upstream repository. Experienced developers might clone [their fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) instead.

<div class="host-code"></div>

```sh
mkdir -p ~/src
cd ~/src
git clone https://github.com/PX4/Firmware.git
cd Firmware
git submodule update --init --recursive
cd ..
```
Now its time to build the binaries by compiling the source code. But before going straight to the hardware, a [simulation run](simulation-sitl.md) is recommended as the next step. Users preferring to work in a graphical development environment should continue with the next section.

### NuttX / Pixhawk based boards

<div class="host-code"></div>

```sh
cd Firmware
make px4fmu-v2_default
```

Note the syntax: 'make' is the build tool, 'px4fmu-v2' is the hardware / autopilot version and 'default' is the default configuration. All PX4 build targets follow this logic. A successful run will end with this output:

<div class="host-code"></div>

```sh
[100%] Linking CXX executable firmware_nuttx
[100%] Built target firmware_nuttx
Scanning dependencies of target build_firmware_px4fmu-v2
[100%] Generating nuttx-px4fmu-v2-default.px4
[100%] Built target build_firmware_px4fmu-v2
```

By appending 'upload' to these commands the compiled binary will be uploaded via USB to the autopilot hardware:

<div class="host-code"></div>

```sh
make px4fmu-v2_default upload
```

A successful run will end with this output:

<div class="host-code"></div>

```sh
Erase  : [====================] 100.0%
Program: [====================] 100.0%
Verify : [====================] 100.0%
Rebooting.

[100%] Built target upload
```
### Raspberry Pi 2 boards
The command below builds the target for Raspbian (posix_pi2_release).

<div class="host-code"></div>

```sh
cd Firmware
make posix_rpi2_release # for cross-compiler build
```

The "mainapp" executable file is in the directory build_posix_rpi2_release/src/firmware/posix.
Copy it over to the RPi (replace YOUR_PI with the IP or hostname of your RPi, [instructions how to access your RPi](hardware-pi2.md#developer-quick-start))

```sh
scp build_posix_rpi2_release/src/firmware/posix/mainapp pi@YOUR_PI:/home/pi/
```

And run it with :
<div class="host-code"></div>

```sh
./mainapp
```


If you're building *directly* on the Pi, you will want the native build target (posix_pi2_default).

<div class="host-code"></div>

```sh
cd Firmware
make posix_rpi2_default # for native build
```

The "mainapp" executable file is in the directory build_posix_rpi2_default/src/firmware/posix.
Run it directly with :
<div class="host-code"></div>

```sh
./build_posix_rpi2_default/src/firmware/posix/mainapp
```

A successful build followed by executing mainapp will give you this :

```sh
[init] shell id: 1996021760
[init] task name: mainapp

______  __   __    ___
| ___ \ \ \ / /   /   |
| |_/ /  \ V /   / /| |
|  __/   /   \  / /_| |
| |     / /^\ \ \___  |
\_|     \/   \/     |_/

Ready to fly.

### QuRT / Snapdragon based boards

#### Build it

The commands below build the targets for the Linux and the DSP side. Both executables communicate via [muORB](advanced-uorb.md).

<div class="host-code"></div>

```sh
cd Firmware
make eagle_default
```

To load the SW on the device, connect via USB cable and make sure the device is booted. Run this in a new terminal window:

<div class="host-code"></div>

```sh
adb shell
```

Go back to previous terminal and upload:

<div class="host-code"></div>

```sh
make eagle_default upload
```

<aside class="note">
Note that this will also copy (and overwrite) the two config files [mainapp.config](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/posix-configs/eagle/flight/mainapp.config) and [px4.config](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/posix-configs/eagle/flight/px4.config) to the device. Those files are stored under /usr/share/data/adsp/px4.config and /home/linaro/mainapp.config respectively if you want to edit the startup scripts directly on your vehicle.
</aside>

The mixer currently needs to be copied manually:

<div class="host-code"></div>

```
adb push ROMFS/px4fmu_common/mixers/quad_x.main.mix  /usr/share/data/adsp
```

#### Run it

Run the DSP debug monitor:

<div class="host-code"></div>

```sh
${HEXAGON_SDK_ROOT}/tools/mini-dm/Linux_Debug/mini-dm
```

Go back to ADB shell and run mainapp:

```sh
cd /home/linaro
./mainapp mainapp.config
```

Note that the mainapp will stop as soon as you disconnect the USB cable (or if you ssh session is disconnected). To fly, you should make the mainapp auto-start after boot.

#### Auto-start mainapp

To run the mainapp as soon as the Snapdragon has booted, you can add the startup to `rc.local`:

Either edit the file `/etc/rc.local` directly on the Snapdragon:

```sh
adb shell
vim /etc/rc.local
```

Or copy the file to your computer, edit it locally, and copy it back:

```sh
adb pull /etc/rc.local
gedit rc.local
adb push rc.local /etc/rc.local
```

For the auto-start, add the following line before `exit 0`:

```
(cd /home/linaro && ./mainapp mainapp.config > mainapp.log)

exit 0
```

Make sure that the `rc.local` is executable:

```
adb shell
chmod +x /etc/rc.local
```

Then reboot the Snapdragon:

```
adb reboot
```

## Compiling in a graphical IDE

The PX4 system supports Qt Creator, Eclipse and Sublime Text. Qt Creator is the most user-friendly variant and hence the only officially supported IDE. Unless an expert in Eclipse or Sublime, their use is discouraged. Hardcore users can find an [Eclipse project](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/.project) and a [Sublime project](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/Firmware.sublime-project) in the source tree.

## Qt Creator Functionality

Qt creator offers clickable symbols, auto-completion of the complete codebase and building and flashing firmware.

![](images/toolchain/qtcreator.png)

### Qt Creator on Linux

Before starting Qt Creator, the [project file](https://cmake.org/Wiki/CMake_Generator_Specific_Information#Code::Blocks_Generator) needs to be created:

<div class="host-code"></div>

```sh
cd ~/src/Firmware
mkdir ../Firmware-build
cd ../Firmware-build
cmake ../Firmware -G "CodeBlocks - Unix Makefiles"
```

Then load the CMakeLists.txt in the root firmware folder via File -> Open File or Project -> Select the CMakeLists.txt file.

After loading, the 'play' button can be configured to run the project by selecting 'custom executable' in the run target configuration and entering 'make' as executable and 'upload' as argument.

### Qt Creator on Windows

<aside class="todo">
Windows has not been tested with Qt creator yet.
</aside>

### Qt Creator on Mac OS

Before starting Qt Creator, the [project file](https://cmake.org/Wiki/CMake_Generator_Specific_Information#Code::Blocks_Generator) needs to be created:

<div class="host-code"></div>

```sh
cd ~/src/Firmware
mkdir build_creator
cd build_creator
cmake .. -G "CodeBlocks - Unix Makefiles"
```

That's it! Start Qt Creator, then complete the steps in the video below to set up the project to build.
